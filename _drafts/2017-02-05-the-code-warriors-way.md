I recently read *[The Code Warrior's way: Mental Training for Rock Climbers](http://warriorsway.com/the-rock-warriors-way-mental-training-for-climbers-2/)* and it helped me overcome some mental hurdles I was facing in climbing and in oher areas of life. I thought it might be helpful for others so I thought it might be a good idea to explain briefly the concepts of rock climbing that relate to the book so you can better relate the text to your own life even if you don't consider yourself a rock climber.
