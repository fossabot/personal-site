      <strong>"The Route Pyramid"</strong>, is a visual representation of a
      specific style of climbing, but more importantly it is an approach to
      progression that emphasizes building a base of routes that are below the
      climber's maximum ability. This approach, and how to perfect it, is
      presented in the popular book <a class="no-underline i light-red"
      target="_blank" href="https://rockclimberstrainingmanual.com/">The Rock
      Climbers Training Manual</a>. Enter your <a class="no-underline light-red"
