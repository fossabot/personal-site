title: About me 
---

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer based in Austin, Texas. 

When I'm not on the clock I like to enjoy the outdoors through climbing, backpacking, and hiking. I'm also a proponent of a more distrbuted food system and enjoy finding new ways to encourage it, whether it be through volunteering on a local farm, building a personal garden, or exploring new software solutions for sustainability.
