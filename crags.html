    <strong>"Is it dry?"</strong>, an oft-repeated, age-old question. Below are real-time,
    precipitation-focused reports of current, past, and future conditions.
    Currently, only crags located in the United States and within a day's
    drive of Austin, TX are included, but nationwide coverage is coming soon.
    All weather data is sourced from <a class="no-underline fancy-link relative light-red" target="_blank" href="https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api">weather.gov</a>.
